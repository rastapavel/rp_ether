# rp_ether

Experiments with smart contracts for ethereum, beginning with the tutorials 
https://mc2-umd.github.io/ethereumlab/docs/serpent_tutorial.pdf, https://www.gitbook.com/book/ethereumbuilders/guide/details and https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/wiki/Using-pyethereum.tester.

The two short term goals are

1. Develop a smart contract for transfers with limits, with limit-override only possible by authorized callers
2. Develop python-based blockchain analytics

The current development branch is `rp_fiddle`
